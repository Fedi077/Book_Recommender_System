Books-Recommender-System-Using-Machine-Learning

Our recommendation system is Hybird based ( Content based + Collaborative filtering based) => figures out the user behavior and the content similarity.

Main Steps of the project:

1- Data Analysis
2- Convertion to pivot table
3- Working on the pivot table
4- Model building: 
  We've used KNN(K- Nearest Neighbor) algorithm (unsupervised learning algorithm): a clustering 
  algoithm which uses 'brut' technique for identifying the cluster.
5- Creating the Web App using streamlit: 
  to run the app: streamlit run app.py
